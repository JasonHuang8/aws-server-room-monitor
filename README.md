# aws-server-room-monitor
A real-time server room monitoring system I built using AWS IoT Core, Lambda, S3, and SNS. It simulates edge sensor data (temperature, humidity, vibration), detects anomalies, and triggers alerts. Designed to showcase cloud-native architecture and event-driven IoT processing.
